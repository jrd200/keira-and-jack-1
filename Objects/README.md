# Objects

Objects are key/value stores of information. You get the value out by knowing what key it is stored under.

Create an HTML file named index.html and a JS file named main.js in this folder. Link them with a script tag. In main.js, work through the following tasks.

## Task 1 - Declaring Objects

In your `main.js`, convert the following sentences into JavaScript objects.

Example:

> My cat is black, his name is Tony, and he loves cuddles.

Becomes...

```js
const myCat = {
  color: "black",
  name: "Tony",
  lovesCuddles: true,
};
```

ðŸ‘‰ Convert the rest!

Create an object called `myHouse`:

> My house has 2 stories, no parking, 2 bedrooms, a garden and an energy efficiency rating of D.

Create an object called `myCar`:

> My car is red, has 4 wheels, power steering, and 2 seats, and does 20 miles per gallon.

Create an object called `myFavouriteFilm`:

> My favourite film's title is The Dark Knight, it was released in 2008, and the lead actor is Christian Bale.

## Task 2 - Reading values

ðŸ‘‰ Copy this object into your JavaScript file.

```js
let person = {
  name: "Ben",
  likesChocolate: true,
};
```

ðŸ‘‰ Below it write an if statement that will console.log `"Ben loves chocolate"` if likesChocolate has a value of true else console.log `"Ben hates chocolate"`. The condition for the if, and the name Ben should both be read from the object using dot notation.

ðŸ‘‰ Change the object's values and re-run your code. The name and the boolean should affect how your program runs.

## Task 3 - Bracket Notation

ðŸ‘‰ Copy this object into your JavaScript file:

```js
let desiredPleasantry = "greeting";

let bensPhrases = {
  greeting: "Well hello there!",
  farewell: "See you in another life, brother",
  smallTalk: "Warm today, isn't it...",
};
```

ðŸ‘‰ Use bracket notation and the `desiredPleasantry` variable to console.log Ben's greeting phrase.

ðŸ‘‰ Change what is console logged by changing the value of `desiredPleasantry`.

## Task 4 - Reassigning Properties

ðŸ‘‰ Copy the object below, and fill in the blank name values to represent yourself, but do not touch the `isBootcamper` key; it must remain as false (just for a little bit...).

```js
let me = {
  firstName: "firstName",
  lastName: "lastName",
  isBootcamper: false,
};
```

ðŸ‘‰ Below your object, reassign the property of `isBootcamper` using the assignment operator. Make it `true`!

## Task 5 - Nested Objects

ðŸ‘‰ Copy this object into your JavaScript file.

```js
let communication = {
  success: true,
  payload: {
    message: {
      text: "Please send biscuits!",
      priority: "URGENT",
    },
  },
};
```

ðŸ‘‰ Using dot notation, read the text from the communication object and store it in a variable.

ðŸ‘‰ If the priority is urgent, then console.log the variable, else do nothing.

## Task 6 - Get Experimental

ðŸ‘‰ Explore objects more. For example, you could...

- Create multi-layered nested objects, and access properties at different layers.
- Create functions that take in information and use that information to create or change objects. For example, you could make a function that took in someone's name and age and return an object for that person with those details as properties.
- Look online in documentation (for example, [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects) or [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp)) about objects in JavaScript. Can you find anything new or surprising?
