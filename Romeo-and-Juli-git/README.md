## _"For never was a story of more woe than code not committed and pushed to Github..."_

Before you know it, the add/commit/push/pull rhythm will become second nature, but to get there, we need to practice. What better way of practicing than to write a fantastic play?

Both of you should start by cloning down this repository on each of your laptops. That way, you'll each have a local copy of what's in the remote repo on Github.

In your pair, then take turns writing a line of dialogue in your play. When you trade your quill pen... ahem, I mean, who's typing, use git commands to add your changes, commit (with a well thought out commit message), and push. Your partner will then use the git command to pull down the changes before adding their next line. Continue this pattern as you write your play.

Remember, the rhythm you want to internalize is:

- **Clone** an existing repository to your local computer and make any changes (or **init** a new one if starting from scratch).
- **Add** all your changes.
- **Commit** your changes (with a human-readable commit message that describes your changes to refer back to later).
- **Push** your changes to the remote repository on Github.
- **Pull** the most recent version of the remote repository to your local copy to make sure you're working on the most up-to-date code.
- Check the git **status** at any time to see what changes are currently committed and other useful information.

## Write Your Masterpiece

One of your pair/team should share their screen and act as the first driver. Then practice the rhythm above in this repository, with each person adding a line to your play before you pass it on.

Add at least ten lines to your play, five lines each person. This means that each person in the pair will add, commit, push, and pull five times each.

If you run into any problems, use `git status` or `git log` in your terminal to see whatâ€™s going on, talk it through with your partner, use the Git cheat sheets and resources from your stage two learning journey as a reference, or search on Google.

## Bonus Tasks

Once you're finished with your play, keep exploring and practicing with Git together.

- Try creating a separate [branch](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches) each. Create your branch locally first, and then push your branches to the remote repository.
- Try co-authoring commits using [this tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors).
- Explore the [git FAQ](http://gitfaq.org/) and try out the commands - treat this repo as a "soft play" area and experiment!
